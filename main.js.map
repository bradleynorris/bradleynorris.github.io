This will infuriate the King in the North! No, not really. If you think Jon will be anything but elated to see his bff, you\\'re crazy. Sam helped Jon by alerting him to the dragon glass mines at Dragonstone, so Jon owes him one. There is speculation that some of the scrolls that Sam took from the Citadel may contain information on how to defeat the Army of the Dead, including some information on how to forge Valyrian Steel weapons. This is a bit of a stretch but surely there has to be something of importance in those dusty old scrolls. The big old elephant in the room though, will be Samwell\\'s discovery regarding Jon\\'s true identity.
